1) Fairness in Streaming Submodular Maximization: Algorithms and Hardness  
  
Fancy Way of Saying they developed some approximation algorithms to assess the quality of different machine learning methods with and without fairness.

2) Fairness without Demographics through Adversarially Reweighted Learning  
  
This algorithm predicts fairness when demographic data is not known, showed that by applying fairness metric to learning model that it increased accuracy scores for sparse data groups.
