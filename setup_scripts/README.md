# Setup Scripts for Project

Only need to run one Shell Script!

TODO:
1. Python Script to download and place all the files. (Need to go back and add each file)
    * Check EACH file is downloaded (get each file hash and dest folder)
    * Note: if the original doesn't work, we can download from my drive.
    * Check for file splitting, Algo won't work with file splitting.
    
2. Update requirements.txt file
